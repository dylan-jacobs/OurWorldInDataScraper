Fish stocks relative to the maximum sustainable yield,Fish stocks are measured by their biomass: the number of individuals multiplied by their mass. Here it's measured as the biomass of a fish stock divided by the biomass at its maximum sustainable yield – the level at which we can catch the maximum amount of fish without a decline in fish populations. A value of one maximises fish catch without decreasing fish populations.,,2017,Black bellied angler ICES 8c-9a,1.20
